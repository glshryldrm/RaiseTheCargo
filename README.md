## 💡 Key Features and Contributions

The core systems developed within this project and my main areas of responsibility are detailed below:

### 👷 Developer Role and Core Mechanics

* **Character Control and Animation:** The character movement system and related animation transitions (state machine logic) were implemented using Unity's modern **New Input System**.
* **Cargo Interaction (Pickup & Drop):** A physics-based interaction mechanic was coded, allowing the character to pick up and drop cargo objects realistically.
* **User Interface (UI) Design:** The game's **Main Menu** interface was designed and implemented, and the menu navigation flow was established.
